# BlazorLibraryWebProject
I made an Library Web Project with C# Blazor first time in my life. The front-end is made using Blazor WebAssembly. Blazor technology is really affective and impresive for me. Because even it is first time for me to use this technology after making some search I easily adapted and made an such an great Web Project. This project is just an beginning for me.
